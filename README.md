## 🎵 Personal Touch
Beyond technology, I find joy in fishing, swimming, and playing jazz drums. 🎶 They provide a balance to my technical pursuits and keep me inspired.

When I'm not coding or diving into data, I find solace in books like [The Solitaire Mystery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Solitaire_Mystery). 📚 It's fascinating to explore different worlds through literature.
