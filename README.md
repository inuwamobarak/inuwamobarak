In addition to my professional interests, I also enjoy fishing, swimming, and playing jazz drums. They provide a balance to my technical pursuits and keep me inspired.

When I'm not coding or diving into data, I find solace in books like [The Solitaire Mystery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Solitaire_Mystery). It's fascinating to explore different worlds through literature.

Feel free to connect with me or reach out if you have any questions or want to discuss exciting ideas. Let's collaborate and create something amazing together!
